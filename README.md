# SWEN225_FinalProject



## CHIP'S CHALLENGE Clone GAME Team 8


Start the game by running nz.ac.wgtn.swen225.lc.app.Main

The game has 2 levels. 

Level 1 simple with only 2 treasures and 1 key to collect.

Level 2 is with 5 actors/enemy and 12 items to collect.

The game has green tiles as background and trees as wall. 

There is also sound in game,it might be loud depending on the volume of testing machine.

Preferably run on IntelliJ/Eclipse.

Spotbugs:There are false positives for Scariest when Tile instances are compared to their subtypes. 
This is invalid as we should be able to compare Subtype instances to super Types to confirm the subType is of the right subType.
